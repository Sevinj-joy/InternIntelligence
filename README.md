## TASK 1
## Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project

##  Problem Definition

**Business Problem:**
Detect fraudulent transactions in banking or payment systems to prevent financial losses and protect customers.

**Business Context:**

* The dataset is imbalanced: the majority of transactions are normal, while fraudulent transactions are rare.
* Business priority: maximize **Recall** to catch as many fraud cases as possible, while keeping **Precision** acceptable to avoid too many false positives.

---

##  Data Collection & Preprocessing

**Data Sources:**

* Credit card transaction datasets (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset)
* Logs, customer info, transaction types, timestamps, etc.

**Preprocessing Steps:**

* Handle missing values
* Scale numerical features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
* Address class imbalance with **resampling techniques** (SMOTE / RandomOverSampler)
* Split data into train and test sets

---

##  Model Selection & Implementation

**Algorithms Used:**

* **Random Forest** → robust and interpretable


**Techniques:**

* Threshold tuning based on **Precision-Recall tradeoff**
* Feature importance analysis

**Python Libraries:**

* `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`

---

## Model Evaluation

**Metrics:**

* **ROC-AUC**, **Precision-Recall AUC** (especially important for imbalanced datasets)
* **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
* Optimal threshold selection according to business priorities

**Visualizations:**

* ROC curve
* Precision-Recall curve
* Threshold vs Precision/Recall/F1 plot

---

##  Deployment

**Deployment Options:**

* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:** for development and testing
* **Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit:** create an API for real-time fraud detection
* **AWS SageMaker / Azure ML:** deploy and monitor model in the cloud

**Monitoring:**

* Track precision and recall on live data
* Retrain or adjust threshold if fraud patterns change

---
